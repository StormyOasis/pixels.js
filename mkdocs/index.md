# PixelsJS Documentation

Pixels.JS is an image filtering library with over 70 photo filters for use in the browser or with Node.JS.

Image filtering comprises vintage filters, solarizers, inverters, and over seventy more.
The photo filters span a variety of genres including vintage, retro, and tinted-themed 
filters. 

To find filters based on a certain category,
then just check for our Category specific pages, which list each of the filters. 

## Installation

## Filter Categories
### Offset Filters
These selection of filters produce a distinct RGB offset, at a specific location. If the offset is marked with extreme in its filter name,
then it the offset is 35 pixels or greater.
Double offset filters consist of two offsets applied, one in each direction, and can consist of a multitude of colours, depending on the filter applied.

Offset filters add a futuristic, technological, almost reminiscient of 3D filters feel to any image.

### Tinted Filters
These filters add or subtract the amount of "red", "blue", or "green" in each pixel, thus adding a slight tint or hue to the image. Perhaps these filters
are most common in photography apps such as Instagram and Snapchat, and are best suited towards those who would like tp
add a warmer or cooler glow to an image. This is usually to do with the amount of red, blue, or green in each pixel.
Pixels.JS can accommodate this by including more than thirty tinted filters in our collection.
